# Notifications

Notifcations are currently a work in progress and will be available soon. Once we have added the notifications feature, this page will be updated.

Currently we are planning on introducing notifications for Discord, Slack, Teams, Telegram, and Webhooks. If you would like to add other notification systems, please feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/Lunalytics/lunalytics/issues) or [create a pull request](https://github.com/Lunalytics/lunalytics/pulls).
