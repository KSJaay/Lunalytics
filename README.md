## üöÄ Getting Started

> [!CAUTION]
>
> This project is under active development and still in beta, things may randomly break. But I'll do my best to fix them as soon as possible.

#### Docker

```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 2308:2308 \
  -v /path/to/data:/app/data \
  -v /path/to/logs:/app/logs \
  ksjaay/lunalytics:latest
```

#### Docker Compose

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  lunalytics:
    image: ksjaay/lunalytics:latest
    container_name: lunalytics
    ports:
      - '2308:2308'
    volumes:
      - ./path/to/data:/app/data
      - ./path/to/logs:/app/logs
```

#### Requirements

git clone https://github.com/KSJaay/Lunalytics.git
cd Lunalytics
```

#### Setup application

```bash
# Setup application
npm run setup

# Start application using scripts
npm run start

# Alternatively start application using
node server/index.js
```

Lunalytics will be accessible on https://localhost:2308

#### Using pm2 to run application in the background

```bash
# Install pm2 globally
npm install pm2 -g

# Start the server
pm2 start server/index.js --name Lunalytics

# Or start the server using script
pm2 start npm --name "Lunalytics" -- run start

# Optional
pm2 save
pm2 startup

## Monitoring console output
pm2 monit
```

## üìñ Backstory

There's a lot of monitoring applications out there and I personally love using uptime-kuma. But, one of the main issues with Uptime-kuma is the ability to share with my friends/colleagues. And for the services that do allow me to share with others, they either have an outdated UI from the 90s or are so expensive I can't justify paying for it.

So I've decided to create my own application that's focused on a developer first experience with support for multiple users.
